**Introduction:**

**Title: CAT 2023 Cutoff and Selection Criteria Dataset for IIMs in India**

**Introduction:**

The CAT 2023 Cutoff and Selection Criteria Dataset is a comprehensive compilation of information on the cutoff scores and selection criteria used by different Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) during their admission process for the academic year 2023. The dataset was meticulously consolidated to provide aspiring students with a one-stop resource that presents category-wise cutoff scores and the diverse set of selection criteria adopted by each IIM.

**Motivation:**

During the process of researching various sources to understand the CAT 2023 cutoffs and selection criteria for different IIMs across India, it was evident that there was no single website containing all the required information. Each IIM had its own unique selection criteria, making it challenging for students to access the relevant data in a centralized manner. Realizing this information gap, I took the initiative to collect and compile the essential details from various sources to build a comprehensive dashboard.

**Contents of the Dataset:**

The dataset comprises two primary sections:

1. **CAT 2023 Cutoff Scores:** This section contains category-wise cutoff scores for each IIM, indicating the minimum CAT score required for consideration during the admission process.

2. **Selection Criteria:** The selection criteria section provides insights into the multiple factors considered by each IIM when inviting candidates for interviews. These factors include:
   - CAT Score: The weightage given to the CAT 2023 score.
   - 10th Score: The weightage assigned to the candidate's performance in the 10th-grade board examination.
   - 12th Score: The weightage given to the candidate's performance in the 12th-grade board examination.
   - Graduation Score: The weightage allocated to the candidate's academic performance during their undergraduate studies.
   - Gender: Some IIMs might consider gender diversity as a factor in the selection process.
   - Work Experience: The weightage given to the candidate's prior work experience, if applicable.
   - Academic Background: Certain IIMs might give preference to candidates from specific academic backgrounds.

**Why Use the Dataset:**

The CAT 2023 Cutoff and Selection Criteria Dataset offer several advantages to prospective MBA aspirants:

1. **Centralized Information:** The dataset consolidates the cutoff scores and selection criteria for all IIMs, enabling candidates to access this crucial information from a single, convenient source.

2. **Informed Decision-making:** By providing insights into the various selection criteria used by each IIM, the dataset helps students understand the specific factors that could influence their admission chances.

3. **Transparency and Preparedness:** With access to category-wise cutoff scores and weightage for different criteria, students can better strategize their application process and prepare for the interviews accordingly.

4. **Kaggle Platform:** Hosting the dataset on Kaggle enhances its accessibility and usability, allowing researchers and data enthusiasts to analyze and visualize the information effectively.

**Conclusion:**

The CAT 2023 Cutoff and Selection Criteria Dataset for IIMs in India serves as a valuable resource for MBA aspirants seeking admission to the prestigious IIMs. With comprehensive data on category-wise cutoff scores and the various selection criteria employed by each institute, this dataset empowers candidates to make well-informed decisions and increase their chances of securing admission to their desired IIM.
